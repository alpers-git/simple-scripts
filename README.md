## My odd collection of code snippets for various purposes. Mostly for 3D scientific volumes.
byte_manipulation:
- swap_endianness.py: Functions to swap endianness of binary data files.
- byte_converter.py: Reinterpret binary files with different data types.
format_conversions:
- tifstack2VTK.py: Convert TIFF stacks to VTK format.
- tif2raw.py: Convert a directory of tif files into raw format volume
- tifstack2raw.py: Convert multi-page TIFF stacks to raw binary format.
mock_data_generation:
- createGrid.py: Generate a linearly changing 3D in one axis volume and save as raw binary.
oddly_specific:
Stufff I wrote for one specific purpose and might be useful again someday.
